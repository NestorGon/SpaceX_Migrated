# spacex_migrated

This project is a pseudo-fork from the original SpaceX Go app developed by Jesus Rodriguez which can be found in the following repo: https://github.com/jesusrp98/spacex-go.

The intention of this repository was to migrate the app from Android Embedding v1 to v2 as the first version doesn't allow to run the app locally on recent flutter updates. Also, the purpose of this migration was to be able to run performance tests and to modify the project to provide basic eventual connectivity scenarios which the original app lacked for a university mobile app development course.
